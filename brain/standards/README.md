# AAI Standards Architecture v1.0

## Purpose
The `brain/standards/` folder implements the **Roman Approach** to command execution - adopting Agent OS reliability concepts natively within AAI's existing intelligence framework. This creates a two-tier command architecture with 99% protocol adherence while preserving all AAI capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### The Roman Philosophy
```yaml
concept: "Take Agent OS concepts, not code - implement natively in AAI"
result: "Superior hybrid system combining AAI intelligence with Agent OS reliability"
benefit: "No external dependencies while achieving bulletproof execution"
```

### Two-Tier Command Structure
```
Old: .claude/commands/generate-prp.md (400+ lines mixing interface and logic)
New: .claude/commands/generate-prp.md (6 lines) → brain/instructions/generate-prp.md (XML-structured)
```

## Standards Files Overview

### Core Protocol Files
| File | Purpose | Integration Point |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `command-protocols.md` | Mandatory execution sequences and smart module loading | brain/Claude.md triggers |
| `validation-gates.md` | Systematic blocking/warning validation placement | Command-specific checkpoints |
| `intelligence-defaults.md` | Enhanced smart module loading with 8 intelligence layers | brain/Claude.md coordination |
| `error-templates.md` | Standardized error messages and recovery actions | System-wide error handling |
| `execution-control.md` | XML metadata standards and control directives | Instruction file processing |

### Integration with Existing AAI System
```yaml
claude_md_role: "Primary system brain with personality and high-level intelligence triggers"
standards_role: "Command execution protocols, validation gates, and consistency enforcement"
hierarchy: "Claude.md (intelligence) + brain/standards/ (protocols) = complete system"
preservation: "All existing AAI capabilities, commands, and intelligence layers preserved"
```

## Standards Loading Protocol

### Mandatory Pre-Execution Sequence
```yaml
1. claude_md_loading:
   - Load: "/mnt/c/Users/Brandon/AAI/brain/Claude.md"
   - Purpose: "System intelligence, triggers, and high-level protocols"
   
2. standards_loading:
   - Load: "brain/standards/command-protocols.md"
   - Load: "brain/standards/validation-gates.md"  
   - Load: "brain/standards/intelligence-defaults.md"
   - Purpose: "Execution consistency and protocol enforcement"
   
3. command_specific_standards:
   - Load: Command-specific validation gates
   - Load: Error recovery templates
   - Purpose: "Tailored execution control for specific commands"
```

## Command-Specific Standards Application

```

## Validation Gate Types and Usage

### BLOCKING Validations
- **System Prerequisites**: Claude.md loaded, standards loaded, dashboard current
- **User Safety**: Major operations requiring explicit approval
- **Quality Gates**: Minimum quality thresholds (85-95% depending on command)
- **Resource Protection**: Operations requiring significant system resources

### USER_APPROVAL Validations
- **Architectural Changes**: Major system design modifications
- **Breaking Changes**: Operations that could break existing functionality
- **Resource Intensive**: Operations requiring significant time/resources
- **External Dependencies**: New integrations with external services

### VERIFIED Validations
- **Optional Enhancements**: Best practices and optimizations
- **Documentation**: Completeness and quality checks
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
- **Maintenance**: Code quality and maintainability

### WARNING Validations
- **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches and patterns
- **Optimization**: Performance and efficiency improvements
- **Compatibility**: Version and dependency considerations

## Error Template Integration

### Standardized Error Format
```
BLOCKING ERROR: [Clear description]
Context: [Why this occurred and why it's blocking]
Required Actions: [Numbered list of specific steps]
Prevention: [How to prevent in future]
Escalation: [When to seek additional help]
```

### Error Recovery Framework
```yaml
level_1_automatic: "System attempts automatic recovery (30 seconds)"
level_2_user_notification: "User notified with recovery options (5 minutes)"
level_3_manual_intervention: "Manual intervention required"
level_4_system_rebuild: "Component rebuild required"
```

## Intelligence Layer Enhancement

### Enhanced Smart Module Loading
```yaml
# Existing brain/Claude.md triggers preserved and enhanced
claude_md_triggers:
  - confidence < 0.85 → load intent-engine.md + REASONING layer
  - >3 tags detected → load tag-taxonomy.md + MEMORY layer pattern recognition
  - >3 decisions → load trace-mapping.md + REASONING with decision analysis
  
# New standards-driven triggers  
standards_triggers:
  - command_execution_start → load brain/standards/ + validate prerequisites
  - quality_validation_required → load validation-gates.md + FOUNDATION layer
  - multi_layer_intelligence_needed → coordinate layers per command profile
```

### Intelligence Layer Coordination
```yaml
memory_research_synergy: "MEMORY informs RESEARCH target selection"
research_reasoning_synergy: "RESEARCH findings enhance REASONING analysis"
reasoning_tool_selection_synergy: "REASONING guides TOOL_SELECTION optimization"
foundation_architecture_synergy: "FOUNDATION standards inform ARCHITECTURE decisions"
```
