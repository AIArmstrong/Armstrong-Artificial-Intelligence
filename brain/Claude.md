/analyze --security codebase/
  → Enhanced with: [MEMORY + HYBRID_RAG + REASONING + RESEARCH + FOUNDATION]
  → Result: Comprehensive analysis with multi-dimensional intelligence
```

## 🔧 Core Rules & Triggers

### Essential Principles
- **Documentation is source of truth** - Your knowledge is out of date, freshly scraped documentation is absolute truth, NOT your own knowledge
- **Docker & Self-testing** - Must use Docker CLI, unit tests, everything confirmed working perfectly before delivery
- **Check all Jina scrapes** - Retry failed scrapes until you get actual content, scrape 30-100 pages total
- **Refer to research** - Before implementing features using third-party APIs, use research documentation for accuracy, never assume knowledge
- **Examples are memory bank** - Use `examples/` recommendations before implementing
- **Neural reasoning required** - Include WHY rationale + confidence score (70-95%) for decisions
- **Auto-learning active** - Systems capture patterns from successful implementations
- **Context Engineering** - Follow established PRP workflow (.claude/commands/)
- **Modular Architecture** - Keep files <500 lines, extract complexity to modules
- **CRITICAL: Module Creation Protocol** - Before creating ANY new module:
  1. **Search existing modules** - Check if functionality already exists in `/brain/modules/` and `/brain/workflows/`
  2. **Enhancement over creation** - If similar functionality exists, enhance the existing module instead of creating new
  3. **Collaboration requirement** - If new module needed, design it to collaborate with supporting/related existing modules
  4. **Integration validation** - Ensure new module integrates with existing scoring, tagging, and intelligence systems
  5. **Auto-trigger setup** - Add appropriate triggers to Smart Module Loading for automatic activation
- **Always reference recent learning events** - Before executing any new task, you must:
  - Check `/brain/workflows/feedback-learning.md` for relevant corrections in the past 3 days
  - If a similar error occurred previously, adjust your plan and include a "Lesson Considered" note in your rationale
  - If no relevant entries exist, proceed—but tag the task for possible later review (#learn)

## 🔧 Core Research Engine Principles

### Unified Intelligence Coordination
**ALL modules work together** - not as isolated tools but as a coordinated research organism:

```yaml
# The Research Engine never sleeps
ALWAYS_ACTIVE: [memory-layer, reasoning-cortex, tool-intelligence, example-patterns]

# Automatic Module Coordination for Research Excellence
research_task_detected:
  → ALL relevant modules activate simultaneously
  → Information flows seamlessly between modules
  → Each module enhances others' capabilities
  → Collective intelligence emerges from coordination

# No module works alone - synergy is mandatory
module_coordination_rules:
  - Research findings → enhance reasoning analysis
  - Reasoning insights → guide tool selection
  - Tool results → inform architecture decisions
  - Architecture choices → update learning patterns
  - Learning patterns → improve future research
```

### The Three Pillars of Research Excellence

#### 1. COMPREHENSIVE DISCOVERY
- **Leave no stone unturned**: 30-100 pages of documentation per research topic via Jina API
- **Multi-source validation**: Cross-reference findings across sources
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify connections others miss
- **Quality over quantity**: 95% accuracy threshold for all findings

#### 2. INTELLIGENT SYNTHESIS
- **Cross-domain insights**: Connect ideas from disparate fields
- **Reasoning chains**: O1-style step-by-step analysis with evidence
- **Confidence scoring**: 70-95% range with clear rationale
- **Alternative perspectives**: Always consider multiple approaches

#### 3. FLAWLESS EXECUTION
- **Tool mastery**: Select optimal tools for each task
- **Parallel processing**: Maximize efficiency through coordination
- **Continuous validation**: Test and verify at every step
- **Learning integration**: Every execution improves the system

## 🔬 Research & Documentation Protocols

### Research Requirements
- **Always scrape 30-100 pages total** using Jina API for comprehensive research
- **Put successful Jina scrapes** in research/ with tech-named directories and .md/.txt files
- **Stick to OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION PAGES ONLY** - No outdated tutorials
- **For maximum efficiency** - Invoke multiple tools simultaneously for independent operations
- **Take user's tech specifications as sacred truth** - Research exact model names, API versions specified

### Jina API Integration
```yaml
jina_research_protocol:
  scraping_requirements:
    - minimum_pages: 30
    - maximum_pages: 100
    - target_content: "official documentation only"
    - storage_format: "markdown with metadata"
    
  quality_validation:
    - verify_official_source: true
    - check_content_relevance: 95%
    - retry_failed_scrapes: true
    - organize_by_topic: true
```

### Research Engine Integration
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Single source of truth with organized symlink access
- **Dual Quality System**: General research ≥0.90, Project research ≥0.75
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence**: GeneralResearcher + ProjectResearcher with auto-promotion
- **Semantic Search**: OpenRouter embeddings with keyword fallback
- **Docker + MCP Integration**: Containerized research delegation

### The Sacred Research Commandments
1. **Research First, Always**: Never assume - research everything thoroughly
2. **Documentation is Truth**: Fresh documentation overrides all assumptions
3. **Jina Scraping Excellence**: Always scrape 30-100 pages with Jina API for comprehensive research
4. **Synthesize Everything**: Connect findings across all sources and modules
5. **Validate Ruthlessly**: 95% confidence or iterate until achieved
6. **Learn Continuously**: Every task must improve the system

### Agent Design Philosophy
- **Agents as intelligent human beings** - Give them decision making, detailed Jina research capabilities
- **Never use programmatic solutions** - Use reasoning and AI decision making for all problems
- **Every agent needs 5+ prompts** in agentic workflow to create unique content
- **Context continuity** - Each agent should have context of previous iterations
- **Dynamic prompts** - Never hardcode examples, make everything dynamic/contextual

## 🏗️ Code Structure & Quality

### Modularity Rules
- **Never create files longer than 500 lines** - Refactor into modules/helpers
- **Organize by feature/responsibility** with clear separation:
  - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic
  - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent
  - `prompts.py` - System prompts
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages)
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables

### Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests** for new features (functions, classes, routes)
- **After updating logic** - Check and update existing unit tests
- **Tests live in `/tests` folder** mirroring main app structure
- **Include at least**: 1 expected use test, 1 edge case, 1 failure case
- **Use Docker commands** for all Python execution including unit tests

### Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as primary language
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, format with `black`
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**
- **Ultrathink capabilities** - Use before PRP generation and code generation stages

## 🚀 COMMAND PROTOCOL - Direct Module Integration

**ALL COMMANDS must reference this protocol to guarantee module usage**

```yaml
# COMMAND PROTOCOL: Direct delegation pattern for guaranteed execution
when (command_executed):
  reference: "brain/CLAUDE.md → Command Protocol → Smart Module Loading"
  guarantee: "Smart Module Loading activates appropriate modules based on context"
  pattern: "Direct delegation beats elaborate discovery"

# Commands reference Smart Module Loading triggers below for automatic activation
```

## 🎯 Intelligence Triggers

- **Intent Analysis**: Every command → intent-engine classification
- **Pattern Matching**: Recipe selection → prompt-recipes consultation
- **Tag Evolution**: Auto-taxonomy → tag-taxonomy management
- **Correlation Mapping**: Decision networks → trace-mapping analysis
- **Performance Tracking**: Success metrics → score-tracker updates
- **Documentation Intelligence**: Task completion (score ≥4.0) → auto-generate SOP
- **Examples Intelligence**: Before tasks → check recommendations, after tasks → update scoring
- **Neural Reasoning**: Decision required → apply WHY analysis + confidence scoring
- **Creative Optimization**: Ideation sessions → cognitive mode switching (#Innovator/#Critic/#Enhancer/#Logic)
- **Architectural Decisions**: Before making architectural or strategic decisions:
  - Review `/brain/docs/explain.md` for prior rationale
  - Use `/brain/docs/decision-trace.mmd` to visualize existing decision flows
  - If unclear, trigger auto-generation of updated trace (via trace-mapping module)
- **SOP Generation**: After task completion:
  - If task score ≥4.0, generate or update SOP in `/docs/sops/`
  - Use patterns from `examples/` and `PRPs/` to auto-fill SOP steps
  - Cross-reference official guidance from `/docs/official/` before finalizing
- **Ideation Intelligence**: During ideation or strategic planning:
  - Use `/ideas/idea_registry.md` to:
    - Generate prompts via innovation modes: #Innovator, #Critic, #Enhancer, #Logic
    - Score feasibility using success-scoring.md
    - Auto-trigger research if idea meets confidence threshold
- **Examples Intelligence**: Before any new task:
  → Claude must check `/examples/` for matching implementation patterns
  → Prioritize high-scoring examples from `score-tracker.md`
  After task completion:
  → If successful outcome, log implementation snippet to `/examples/` with tags and task type
  → If it involved testing, update or create test in `/examples/tests/`
  Claude must distinguish:
  - `/examples/core/` → Reusable patterns and validated code
  - `/examples/tests/` → Test suites for functional accuracy (linked to PRPs)

## 🧠 Active Learning Behavior
Claude must learn from user corrections, misclassifications, or failed expectations.

Log these events in:
- `/brain/workflows/feedback-learning.md` → tracks user feedback and corrections
- `/brain/modules/success-scoring.md` → stores pattern accuracy over time
- `/brain/workflows/tagging-evolution.md` → tracks tag accuracy and learning

Claude must not modify this file (Claude.md) directly to log learning.

Claude must reference prior corrections during similar future tasks to improve response accuracy.

Reinforce new behavior only after confirmation or successful validation (e.g., via `/log status`)

### Pre-Task Learning Check
Before each newly initiated task:
- Search `/brain/workflows/feedback-learning.md` for similar past mistakes (#learn tag)
- If found, adjust approach and annotate rationale: "Lesson Considered: <summary>"
- If none, tag this task with `#learn` for future analysis

### Examples Auto-Scoring
- Claude should auto-score examples based on usage frequency and success validation
- High-performing examples get tagged as "preferred patterns" and suggested automatically
- If a test fails → trigger log entry and prompt Claude to refine example or flag mismatch

## 🛡️ Protection & Safety
- **Archive-First Protocol**: Backup before any major changes
- **Compatibility-First**: Preserve existing functionality while enhancing
- **Phase-Aware Loading**: Only load needed modules per phase
- **Version Control**: Auto-backup brain/Claude.md before modifications

### Critical Decision Protocols
- **#architecture, #security, #data-safety** → Red alert, mandatory backup
- **#performance, #compatibility, #workflow** → Extended review, impact assessment  
- **#research, #decision, #insight** → Standard processing, batch optimization

### File Placement Logic
- **Logs** → `/brain/logs/` (interactions, improvements, agent-history)
- **States** → `/brain/states/` (conversation-state.json, project contexts)
- **Workflows** → `/brain/workflows/` (intent-registry.md, prompt-history.md)
- **Modules** → `/brain/modules/` (intelligence capabilities)
- **Cache** → `/brain/cache/` (Supabase-backed volatile memory)
- **Research** → `/research/` (Jina-scraped documentation findings - organized by tech)
