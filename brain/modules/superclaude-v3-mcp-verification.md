## üéØ Integration Recommendations

### For AAI Production
1. **Enable All MCP Servers**: Full functionality with Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright
2. **Use Auto-Activation**: Let v3 intelligently select servers based on task
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track response times and server health
4. **Configure Fallbacks**: Ensure graceful degradation when servers unavailable

### Configuration Steps
```bash
# 1. Verify MCP servers are available in Claude Code
# Check Claude Code settings for MCP server configuration

# 2. Test MCP integration
/sc:analyze --code --seq
/sc:design --ui --magic
/sc:document --api --c7
/sc:test --e2e --play

# 3. Monitor performance
# Check response times and server health in Claude Code
```

## üìã Migration Notes

### From v2 MCP Integration
```yaml
v2_to_v3_changes:
  server_coordination: "Enhanced multi-server coordination"
  auto_activation: "Improved automatic server selection"
  performance: "Better caching and optimization"
  error_handling: "Robust fallback strategies"
```

### Compatibility Assurance
- **‚úÖ Same MCP Servers**: Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Features**: Better integration and coordination
- **‚úÖ Backward Compatible**: v2 workflows continue to work
- **‚úÖ AAI Integration**: Seamless with existing AAI architecture

## üöÄ Final Assessment

### MCP Integration Status
