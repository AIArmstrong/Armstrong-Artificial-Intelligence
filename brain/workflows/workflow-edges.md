```

### Correlation Strength Indicators
- **0.95-1.0**: Critical dependency (change one, must review other)
- **0.85-0.94**: Strong correlation (likely needs coordination)
- **0.70-0.84**: Moderate correlation (consider impact)
- **0.50-0.69**: Weak correlation (monitor for unexpected effects)
- **<0.50**: Minimal correlation (independent decisions)

### Systemic Decision Patterns
#### High-Impact Clusters
1. **Architecture + Infrastructure**: Brain design drives storage/API choices
2. **Workflow + Intelligence**: Smart features enable better user experience
3. **Safety + Organization**: Archive strategy supports cleanup operations

#### Risk Correlation Zones
- **Single Point of Failure**: OpenRouter dependency affects multiple features
- **Cascade Triggers**: File routing changes could impact entire brain system
- **Integration Risks**: SuperClaude bridge affects both archiving and intelligence

### Learning from Correlations
#### Successful Patterns
- **Compatibility-First**: Decisions that preserve existing functionality succeed
- **Modular Integration**: Bridge/adapter patterns reduce correlation complexity
- **Phased Rollout**: Staged implementation reduces systemic risk

#### Warning Signals
- **High Correlation Count**: Decisions affecting >5 other areas need extra care
- **Circular Dependencies**: When A→B→C→A creates fragile systems
- **Orphaned Decisions**: Decisions with <2 correlations may be unnecessary
