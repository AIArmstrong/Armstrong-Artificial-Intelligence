# Prompt History & Evolution

## Purpose
Track prompt patterns, successful approaches, and optimization over time.

## Session: AAI System Overhaul (2025-01-13)

### Initial Analysis Phase
- **Pattern**: Comprehensive system analysis with --ultrathink
- **Success**: Identified phantom references in Claude.md
- **Learning**: Always verify file references before implementing

### Architecture Design Phase  
- **Pattern**: Brain-centric design with modular intelligence
- **Success**: Preserved context engineering while adding enhancements
- **Learning**: Compatibility checking prevents breaking existing workflows

### Implementation Phase
- **Pattern**: Phased implementation with todo tracking
- **Success**: Clean execution without data loss
- **Learning**: Archive-first approach maintains reference materials

## üéñÔ∏è Prompt Recipe Blocks (Phase 1 Enhancement)

### System Audit Before Enhancement
**Trigger**: Major system changes or overhauls
**Recipe**:
1. Read all existing configuration files
2. Identify phantom/broken references
3. Map current file structure and dependencies
4. Archive/backup before modifications
5. Implement with compatibility preservation
**Success Rate**: 95% | **Use Cases**: Architecture changes, system upgrades

### Compatibility-First Architecture
**Trigger**: Integrating new features with existing systems
**Recipe**:
1. Analyze existing patterns and conventions
2. Design bridge/adapter layers for integration
3. Test compatibility with current workflows
4. Implement modular additions (don't replace)
5. Validate all existing functionality still works
**Success Rate**: 90% | **Use Cases**: Feature additions, third-party integrations

### Intelligent File Routing
**Trigger**: Content placement decisions
**Recipe**:
1. Analyze content type and purpose
2. Check existing file routing patterns
3. Apply smart placement rules from brain/Claude.md
4. Use /log command for dynamic routing decisions
5. Learn from user corrections for future routing
**Success Rate**: 85% | **Use Cases**: Documentation, logging, cache management

### Phased Implementation Strategy
**Trigger**: Complex multi-step projects
**Recipe**:
1. Break down into logical phases (3-5 max)
2. Use TodoWrite for tracking and visibility
3. Complete each phase fully before next
4. Test and validate after each phase
5. Gather feedback before proceeding
**Success Rate**: 88% | **Use Cases**: Large features, system overhauls

### Archive-First Data Safety
**Trigger**: File movements, deletions, or major edits
**Recipe**:
1. Create timestamped backup/archive
2. Verify backup integrity
3. Perform operation on copy first
4. Test and validate changes
5. Only then modify original
**Success Rate**: 99% | **Use Cases**: Cleanup operations, migrations

### Decision Correlation Mapping
**Trigger**: Related decisions affecting multiple areas
**Recipe**:
1. Identify all affected components
2. Map decision dependencies and impacts
3. Document rationale with future context
4. Update explain.md with correlation notes
5. Create decision trace for reversal tracking
**Success Rate**: 80% | **Use Cases**: Architecture decisions, workflow changes

## Successful Patterns
1. **Analysis Before Action**: Always audit existing structure first
2. **Compatibility First**: Preserve working systems while enhancing
3. **Modular Design**: Keep declarative rules separate from dynamic modules
4. **Protection Protocols**: Backup before major changes

## Optimization Notes
- Use TodoWrite for complex multi-step operations
- Batch file operations when possible
- Verify references exist before implementation
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
