# 🎭 Agent Thinking Modes - Creative Cortex
*Cognitive Mode Switching for Enhanced Ideation*

## 🧠 Mode Architecture

### Core Principle
Different cognitive modes optimize for different types of thinking:
- **Divergent thinking** (#Innovator) - Generate many possibilities
- **Convergent thinking** (#Logic) - Focus on feasibility  
- **Critical thinking** (#Critic) - Find problems and risks
- **Iterative thinking** (#Enhancer) - Refine and improve

### Mode Switching Protocol
```
Default Mode: #Innovator
Switch Command: Add hashtag to any idea entry
Example: "Smart home automation #Critic"
```

## 🚀 #Innovator Mode

### Cognitive Profile
- **Primary Goal**: Generate radical, novel concepts
- **Constraints**: None - pure creative flow
- **Evaluation**: Suspended during ideation
- **Output Style**: Stream of consciousness, wild ideas

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Idea Generation**: Rapid-fire brainstorming
- **Associations**: Free association, unexpected connections
- **Constraints**: Ignore feasibility, cost, logic
- **Scope**: Think beyond current limitations

### Innovator Prompts
- "What if we could..."
- "Imagine if..."
- "What's the wildest way to..."
- "If money/time/physics weren't constraints..."

### Example Innovator Session
```
💡 Idea: AI-powered dream recording system
💡 Idea: Telepathic code collaboration
💡 Idea: Time-travel debugging (view past code states)
💡 Idea: Emotion-based UI that adapts to user mood
💡 Idea: Quantum-entangled pair programming
```

## 🔍 #Critic Mode

### Cognitive Profile
- **Primary Goal**: Identify flaws, risks, and challenges
- **Constraints**: Focus on problems, not solutions
- **Evaluation**: Harsh reality testing
- **Output Style**: Systematic challenge identification

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong?
- **Feasibility Testing**: Is this actually possible?
- **Resource Analysis**: What will this cost?
- **Adoption Barriers**: Why might users reject this?

### Critic Evaluation Framework
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can we build this?
- **Market Viability**: Will people want this?
- **Resource Requirements**: Do we have what it takes?
- **Failure Modes**: How might this fail?
- **Unintended Consequences**: What are the side effects?

### Example Critic Session
```
🔍 Idea: AI-powered dream recording system
❌ Privacy concerns - who controls dream data?
❌ Technical infeasibility - current neuroscience limitations
❌ Ethical issues - involuntary thought monitoring
❌ Market resistance - too invasive for mainstream adoption
⚠️ Regulatory challenges - medical device approval needed
```

## ⚡ #Enhancer Mode

### Cognitive Profile
- **Primary Goal**: Iterate and improve existing ideas
- **Constraints**: Build on current concepts
- **Evaluation**: Improvement-focused
- **Output Style**: Incremental refinements

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Iteration**: Make it better, faster, cheaper
- **Combination**: Merge complementary ideas
- **Simplification**: Remove unnecessary complexity
- **Optimization**: Maximize value/effort ratio

### Enhancement Techniques
- **Feature Addition**: What capabilities are missing?
- **User Experience**: How can we make it more intuitive?
- **Performance**: How can we make it faster/cheaper?
- **Integration**: How does it connect to existing systems?

### Example Enhancer Session
```
⚡ Idea: Creative Cortex v2.0
→ Add voice-to-text idea capture
→ Integrate with existing project management
→ Create mobile app for on-the-go ideation
→ Add collaborative features for team brainstorming
→ Implement AI-powered idea similarity detection
```

## 🧮 #Logic Mode

### Cognitive Profile
- **Primary Goal**: Ground truth and feasibility assessment
- **Constraints**: Evidence-based reasoning only
- **Evaluation**: Rigorous analysis required
- **Output Style**: Structured, analytical

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Data-Driven**: Base decisions on evidence
- **Cost-Benefit**: Quantify value propositions
- **Timeline**: Realistic implementation planning
- **Resource Allocation**: Efficient use of constraints

### Logic Analysis Framework
- **Technical Feasibility**: Engineering requirements
- **Economic Viability**: Cost-benefit analysis
- **Market Validation**: User research needed
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step roadmap
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes

### Example Logic Session
```
🧮 Idea: Neural Decision System
✅ Technical: Proven technology stack
✅ Economic: Low implementation cost (~40 hours)
✅ Market: Addresses real user need (decision tracking)
✅ Timeline: 2-week implementation window
📊 Success Metrics: Decision accuracy +15%, Time savings 2hr/week
💰 Investment: $0 (existing resources)
📈 ROI: High (productivity gains)
```

## 🔄 Mode Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Mode Usage
1. **#Innovator** → Generate raw ideas
2. **#Critic** → Identify major issues
3. **#Enhancer** → Refine and improve
4. **#Logic** → Feasibility assessment

### Parallel Mode Usage
- **Team Brainstorming**: Different people in different modes
- **Idea Validation**: Run same idea through all modes
- **Balanced Thinking**: Switch modes within single session

### Mode Combination Rules
- **Innovator + Critic**: Rapid ideation with immediate filtering
- **Enhancer + Logic**: Optimization with feasibility constraints
- **Critic + Enhancer**: Problem identification with solution focus
- **All Modes**: Comprehensive idea development
