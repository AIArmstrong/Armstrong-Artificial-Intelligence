# /sc:build - Project Building

## Purpose
Build, compile, and package projects with comprehensive error handling and optimization.

## Usage
```
/sc:build [target] [--type dev|prod|test] [--clean] [--optimize]
```

## Arguments
- `target` - Project or specific component to build
- `--type` - Build type (dev, prod, test)
- `--clean` - Clean build artifacts before building
- `--optimize` - Enable build optimizations
- `--verbose` - Enable detailed build output

## Execution

### ðŸ§  ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE MODULES
```yaml
Intelligence_Layers:
  - Memory: "Recall successful build patterns and previous configurations"
  - Foundation: "Apply baseline build validation and quality checks"
  - Tool Selection: "Intelligently choose optimal build tools and commands"
  - Architecture: "Provide build system guidance and optimization recommendations"
  - Research: "Auto-research build configurations and best practices when needed"
  - Reasoning: "Apply WHY analysis for build decisions with 70-95% confidence scoring"
```

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Reference `brain/CLAUDE.md â†’ Command Protocol â†’ Smart Module Loading` to activate build intelligence automatically based on context.

### Supreme Build Mode (Enhanced)
Smart Module Loading automatically activates supreme build capabilities when available, triggering the **8 Enhancement Layers**:

1. **Memory Layer** - Recall successful build patterns and previous configurations
2. **Foundation Layer** - Apply baseline build validation and quality checks
3. **Tool Selection Layer** - Intelligently choose optimal build tools and commands
4. **Architecture Layer** - Provide build system guidance and optimization recommendations
5. **Research Layer** - Auto-research build configurations and best practices when needed
6. **Reasoning Layer** - Apply WHY analysis for build decisions with 70-95% confidence scoring

**Enhanced Build Process**:
1. **Intelligent Analysis** - Multi-dimensional project structure analysis with build pattern recognition
2. **Smart Validation** - Dependency resolution with conflict detection and auto-suggestions
3. **Orchestrated Execution** - Coordinated build process with real-time error monitoring
4. **Adaptive Error Handling** - AI-powered diagnostic analysis with solution recommendations
5. **Performance Optimization** - Build time analysis with caching and parallelization opportunities
6. **Learning Integration** - Capture successful patterns for future builds

### Standard Build Mode (Fallback)
When supreme build is not available:
1. Analyze project structure and build configuration
2. Validate dependencies and environment setup  
3. Execute build process with error monitoring
4. Handle build errors and provide diagnostic information
5. Optimize build output and report results

### Creative Cortex Integration (Phase 3)
- **#Logic Mode** - Structured build process validation and optimization
- **#Enhancer Mode** - Build performance improvements and workflow optimization
- **#Critic Mode** - Build configuration analysis and error prediction
- **Innovation Mode** - Novel build optimization strategies when standard approaches fail

## Enhanced Claude Code Integration
- **Supreme Mode**: Integrates with BuildIntelligence, DependencyResolver, and PerformanceOptimizer
- **Memory Integration**: Learns from successful builds and applies patterns automatically
- **Tool Mastery**: Enhanced Bash execution with intelligent error recovery
- **Configuration Analysis**: Advanced Read capabilities with semantic understanding
- **Progress Orchestration**: TodoWrite coordination with build milestone tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation with predictive error detection
- **Learning System**: Continuous improvement through build success correlation
