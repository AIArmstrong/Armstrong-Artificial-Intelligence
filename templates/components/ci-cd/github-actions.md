# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

## Automated Workflows

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Readiness Checks
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Linting checks pass
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Dependencies up to date

### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        # Deployment commands
        ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, complexity
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, dependency check
- **Performance**: Load testing, benchmark validation
- **Documentation**: API docs, README updates
