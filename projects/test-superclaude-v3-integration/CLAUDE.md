# SuperClaude v3 Integration Test Environment

## Purpose
Isolated testing environment for SuperClaude v3 integration with AAI brain system before production deployment.

## Base AAI Rules
<!-- Import core AAI brain rules -->
@include ../../brain/Claude.md

## SuperClaude v3 Test Integration
<!-- Test v3 integration via direct path -->
@include ../../superclaude-v3/SuperClaude/Core/CLAUDE.md

## Test-Specific Configuration

### Testing Priorities
1. Verify v3 structure compatibility with AAI brain
2. Test new @COMMANDS.md syntax vs v2 @include
3. Validate v3 MCP integration (Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright)
4. Test new /sc: command prefix system
5. Validate v3 personas and orchestration with AAI
6. Test v3 Python installer compatibility

### Expected Behaviors
- Should maintain AAI's core intelligence and modular architecture
- Should have SuperClaude v3's enhanced features (wave mode, improved personas)
- Should work with new command structure (/sc:implement instead of /build)
- Should integrate with AAI's existing bridge system concept

### Critical Tests
1. **Architecture Compatibility**: Does v3 structure work with AAI?
2. **Command Integration**: Do /sc: commands work properly?
3. **Bridge System**: Can AAI bridge adapt to v3 structure?
4. **MCP Integration**: Do v3 MCP servers work with AAI?
5. **Persona System**: Do v3 personas integrate with AAI intelligence?

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Basic v3 functionality
echo "Testing v3 core integration..."

# Test 2: Command structure
echo "Testing /sc:implement vs /build..."

# Test 3: MCP integration
echo "Testing v3 MCP servers..."

# Test 4: Persona system
echo "Testing v3 personas with AAI..."

# Test 5: Bridge compatibility
echo "Testing bridge system adaptation..."
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ V3 structure loads without errors
- ✅ Commands work with /sc: prefix
- ✅ MCP integration functional
- ✅ Personas activate correctly
- ✅ AAI intelligence preserved
- ✅ Bridge system adaptable

### Rollback Plan
If tests fail:
1. Restore v2 backup from archives
2. Revert to v2 bridge system
3. Document issues for future resolution
