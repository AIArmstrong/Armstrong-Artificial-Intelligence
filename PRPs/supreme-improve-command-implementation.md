name: "Supreme /improve Command Implementation - Multi-Dimensional Code Enhancement Engine"
description: |

## Purpose
Transform the `/improve` command from a well-documented template into a production-grade code improvement system that implements genuine multi-dimensional analysis, quality scoring, and systematic enhancement tracking. Build actual working features including:
- Systematic code quality, performance, and maintainability improvements with measurable metrics
- Three review types: code review, architecture review, and debate analysis with scoring
- Multi-dimensional review with real quality scoring algorithms and risk assessment
- Improvement tracking with before/after metrics and success correlation

## Core Principles
1. **Measurable Improvements**: Every improvement must be quantifiable with before/after metrics
2. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Code quality + performance + maintainability + security analysis
3. **Risk-Aware Enhancement**: Safety mechanisms and preview modes to prevent breaking changes
4. **Learning System**: Track improvement outcomes to refine recommendation algorithms
5. **Tool Integration**: Leverage existing Claude Code tools with intelligent orchestration

---

## Goal
Create a production-ready code improvement system that provides measurable, risk-assessed enhancements with systematic tracking and learning capabilities.

## Why
- **Replace Manual Reviews**: Automate systematic code improvement with consistent quality
- **Measurable Impact**: Provide quantifiable metrics for improvement effectiveness
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent improvement-induced bugs through comprehensive analysis
- **Learning System**: Continuously improve recommendation accuracy through outcome tracking
- **Team Efficiency**: Enable faster, more thorough code improvements across projects

## What
A multi-dimensional code improvement engine that:
- Performs systematic code quality, performance, and maintainability analysis
- Generates specific, prioritized improvement recommendations with risk assessment
- Provides preview modes and safety mechanisms to prevent breaking changes
- Tracks improvement outcomes and correlates with project success metrics
- Learns from implementation results to improve future recommendations
- Integrates with existing development workflow and tools

### Success Criteria

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
```python
# CRITICAL: AST parsing requires careful handling of syntax errors
# Pattern: Use ast.parse() with try/catch for malformed code
# Don't assume code parses correctly - handle syntax errors gracefully

# CRITICAL: File modifications must be atomic to prevent corruption
# Pattern: Use temporary files and atomic moves for safety
# Never modify files in place without backup - use existing patterns

# CRITICAL: Claude Code tools have specific token limits
# Pattern: Chunk large files for analysis, use MultiEdit for batch changes
# Don't try to analyze entire large codebases in single calls

# CRITICAL: Quality metrics must be consistent and reproducible
# Pattern: Use deterministic algorithms, cache results for consistency
# Avoid floating-point arithmetic that varies across systems

# CRITICAL: AI model calls need rate limiting and error handling
# Pattern: Use existing openrouter patterns with exponential backoff
# Don't implement new rate limiting - extend existing infrastructure
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't modify files without backup and rollback capabilities
- ❌ Don't trust static analysis tools completely - validate with manual review
- ❌ Don't apply improvements without risk assessment and preview
- ❌ Don't ignore test failures after applying improvements
- ❌ Don't use inconsistent quality scoring - ensure reproducible metrics
- ❌ Don't skip outcome tracking - learning requires feedback loops
- ❌ Don't break existing functionality for marginal quality improvements
- ❌ Don't overwhelm developers with too many recommendations at once
- ❌ Don't ignore team coding standards and preferences
- ❌ Don't implement improvements that developers consistently reject
