description: |

## Purpose
Transform the `/analyze` command from an extensive blueprint into a production AI-powered analysis system that achieves the claimed "98% accuracy" through genuine triple-layer intelligence, predictive capabilities, and multi-agent orchestration. Build working features including:

## Core Principles
1. **Achieve 98% Accuracy**: Build systems that actually deliver the claimed accuracy through validated algorithms
2. **Real Intelligence Layers**: Implement working memory, reasoning, and research systems with measurable outputs
3. **Guarantee Module Usage**: Use Command Protocol → Smart Module Loading for direct delegation

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
```python
# CRITICAL: Multi-agent coordination requires careful async/await management
# Pattern: Use existing primary_agent.py patterns with proper task queuing
# Don't create new async patterns - extend proven delegation_engine.py

# CRITICAL: OpenRouter rate limits need exponential backoff with state tracking
# Pattern: Use existing router_client.py with enhanced backoff for multi-agent
# Don't implement new rate limiting - enhance existing with agent coordination

# CRITICAL: Machine learning models need proper training data and validation
# Pattern: Use scikit-learn with cross-validation for accuracy measurement
# Don't skip model validation - 98% accuracy must be verified and reproducible

# CRITICAL: AST analysis at scale requires memory management and chunking
# Pattern: Process files in batches, use generators for large codebases
# Don't load entire codebase into memory - implement streaming analysis

# CRITICAL: Checkpoint system needs atomic operations and state consistency
# Pattern: Use JSON for state serialization with atomic file operations
# Don't use pickle or complex serialization - keep checkpoint data human-readable

# CRITICAL: Intelligence layer outputs must be measurable and comparable
# Pattern: Use consistent metrics (0-1 confidence, 0-100 quality scores)
# Don't use arbitrary scoring - implement standardized measurement interfaces

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't fake 98% accuracy - implement genuine measurement and validation
- ❌ Don't implement "intelligence" without measurable outputs and learning
- ❌ Don't create new multi-agent patterns - enhance existing proven systems
- ❌ Don't skip rate limiting - use existing patterns with agent coordination
- ❌ Don't ignore checkpoint requirements - implement robust state recovery
- ❌ Don't use sync functions in async agent contexts
- ❌ Don't skip ML model validation - predictive accuracy must be verified
- ❌ Don't implement without comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- ❌ Don't ignore performance requirements - optimize for 5-minute analysis
- ❌ Don't break existing brain system integration - extend, don't replace

---

## Command Protocol Integration Requirements

### Critical Implementation Requirement
**The enhanced `/analyze` command MUST reference the Command Protocol to guarantee module usage:**

```yaml
command_protocol_integration:
  reference_required: "brain/CLAUDE.md → Command Protocol → Smart Module Loading"
  pattern_implementation: "Direct delegation beats elaborate discovery"
  guarantee: "Smart Module Loading automatically activates supreme analyze modules based on context"
  
module_activation_triggers:
  analysis_context:
    - if (semantic analysis needed) → load enhanced-repository-analyzer.py + foundational-rag-agent.py
    - if (architectural decisions) → load decision-neural.md + tech-stack-expert.py
    - if (performance review mode) → load score-tracker.md + unified-analytics.py
    - if (research_needed) → COORDINATE_ALL: [github-analyzer, enhanced-repository-analyzer, research-prp-integration]
    
supreme_analyze_enhancements:
  smart_loading_ensures: "All created supreme analyze modules integrate with existing trigger system"
  no_discovery_needed: "Command directly delegates to Smart Module Loading for guaranteed activation"
  fallback_protected: "If supreme modules unavailable, Smart Loading falls back to existing patterns"
```

### Integration Validation
```yaml
integration_requirements:
  command_reference: "/.claude/commands/analyze.md must reference Command Protocol"
  smart_loading_triggers: "Enhanced modules must integrate with existing Smart Module Loading triggers"
  direct_delegation: "No hope-based integration - guaranteed module activation through protocol"
```
