# GitHub Repository Analyzer & Integrator - Project Requirements Plan (PRP)

## Overview
An intelligent GitHub repository analysis and integration tool that automatically identifies, evaluates, and integrates valuable features from external repositories into the AAI ecosystem.

## Problem Statement
As the AAI ecosystem scales, manually evaluating and integrating useful features from external repositories is time-consuming and error-prone. We need an automated system that can:
- Analyze repository code and architecture
- Identify reusable features and patterns
- Assess compatibility with our system
- Auto-generate integration code and documentation
- Track integration success metrics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully analyze and extract features from 10+ diverse repositories
- [ ] Achieve 85%+ accuracy in feature relevance scoring
- [ ] Auto-generate working integration stubs for 70%+ of high-scored features
- [ ] Reduce manual integration time by 300%+
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities introduced through integrations
- [ ] 90%+ of auto-generated tests pass on first run

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

#### 1. Repository Analysis Engine
```python
class RepositoryAnalyzer:
    """Main orchestrator for repository analysis"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cloner = GitCloner()
        self.sandbox = DockerSandbox()
        self.analyzers = {
            'structure': CodeStructureAnalyzer(),
            'security': SecurityAuditAnalyzer(),
            'quality': QualityAssessmentAnalyzer(),
            'integration': IntegrationScoutAnalyzer(),
            'performance': PerformanceProfilerAnalyzer()
        }
        
    async def analyze_repository(self, repo_url: str) -> AnalysisReport:
        # Clone to isolated environment
        # Run multi-agent analysis
        # Generate comprehensive report
        # Score features for integration
```

#### 2. Feature Extraction Pipeline
- **AST Analysis**: Parse code structure for all supported languages
- **API Surface Mapping**: Identify exported functions, classes, interfaces
- **Dependency Graph**: Map internal and external dependencies
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify design patterns and architectural choices
- **Semantic Understanding**: Use LLM for purpose and context analysis

#### 3. Compatibility Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_feature_score(feature: ExtractedFeature) -> float:
    """
    Multi-factor scoring algorithm for integration compatibility
    """
    weights = {
        'relevance_to_projects': 0.30,
        'code_quality': 0.20,
        'integration_complexity': 0.20,  # Inverse - lower is better
        'reusability': 0.15,
        'security_compliance': 0.15
    }
    
    # Calculate individual scores
    # Apply weights
    # Return composite score (0.0-1.0)
```

#### 4. Integration Artifact Generator
- **Code Stubs**: Ready-to-use integration code
- **Test Suites**: Comprehensive tests for integrated features
- **Documentation**: Usage guides and API references
- **Examples**: Working implementation examples
- **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step integration instructions

### Module Integration Points

1. **analyze_orchestrator.py**
   - Extend for multi-agent repository analysis
   - Reuse rate limiting and error handling

2. **integration-aware-prp-enhancer.py**
   - Feed analysis results for PRP enhancement
   - Auto-detect integration opportunities

3. **research-prp-integration.py**
   - Store repository analysis in research database
   - Enable cross-repository pattern detection

4. **seamless-orchestrator.py**
   - Trigger PRP generation for high-value features
   - Auto-scaffold integration projects

5. **unified-analytics.py**
   - Track integration success metrics
   - Monitor feature adoption rates

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Create `brain/modules/github-analyzer.py` main module
- [ ] Implement GitCloner with isolation
- [ ] Setup Docker sandbox environment
- [ ] Basic AST parsing for Python/JavaScript
- [ ] Simple API extraction

#### Phase 2: Intelligence (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement multi-agent analysis system
- [ ] Add semantic analysis via OpenRouter
- [ ] Create feature scoring algorithm
- [ ] Pattern matching against existing codebase
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

#### Phase 3: Automation (Week 3)
- [ ] Auto-PRP generation for high-score features
- [ ] Integration stub generation
- [ ] Test suite auto-generation
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Example code creation

#### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Week 4)
- [ ] Dashboard integration
- [ ] Success metrics tracking
- [ ] Continuous learning implementation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11+
- Docker SDK for Python
- GitPython
- AST parsing libraries (ast, tree-sitter)
- Security scanning tools (bandit, safety)
- OpenRouter API for semantic analysis

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Each analyzer component
2. **Integration Tests**: Full pipeline with sample repos
3. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability injection detection
4. **Performance Tests**: Large repository handling
5. **E2E Tests**: Complete analysis â†’ integration flow

## Risk Mitigation
- **Security**: All code runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Quality**: Multi-stage validation before integration
- **Compatibility**: Extensive testing in sandbox first
- **Legal**: License compatibility checking
- **Performance**: Async processing and caching

## Success Metrics
- Analysis accuracy rate
- Feature adoption rate
- Time saved vs manual integration
- Bug rate in integrated code
- Developer satisfaction score

## Future Enhancements
