- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing knowledge specific to project needs

### 2. Project-Specific Intelligence
- **Architecture Integration**: Researches how technology fits into project architecture
- **Constraint Analysis**: Accounts for project-specific limitations and requirements
- **Custom Implementation**: Researches project-specific implementations and configurations
- **Performance Optimization**: Focuses on project-specific performance considerations

### 3. Rapid Validation
- **Focused Scope**: Targets specific project needs rather than comprehensive coverage
- **Quick Validation**: Faster validation cycle appropriate for project timelines
- **Contextual Examples**: Creates examples specific to project context
- **Integration Testing**: Validates integration with existing project components
