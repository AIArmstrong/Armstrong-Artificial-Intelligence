## Contradiction Log

### Initial Setup
*No contradictions detected yet - this file will track research conflicts and their resolutions.*

## Categories
- **source-conflict**: Different sources provide conflicting information
- **version-mismatch**: API versions or documentation out of sync
- **project-override**: Project-specific research conflicts with general knowledge
- **temporal-drift**: Previously valid research now contradicted by updates

## Resolution Process
1. **Identify** - Auto-detect or manual flag
2. **Research** - Investigate source credibility and recency
3. **Resolve** - Update knowledge base with correct information
4. **Archive** - Move outdated research to archive with explanation
