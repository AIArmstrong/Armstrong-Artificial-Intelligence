# Anthropic Documentation Quick Reference for AAI

## Analysis Enhancement Guidelines

### When performing code analysis:
- **Reference**: `/docs/official/anthropic/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct.md`
- **Apply**: Clear, specific analysis prompts with explicit goals
- **Pattern**: Structure analysis with defined scope and success criteria

### When doing security analysis:
- **Reference**: `/docs/official/anthropic/api/errors.md`
- **Apply**: Systematic error pattern recognition for vulnerability detection
- **Pattern**: Use chain-of-thought reasoning for threat assessment

### When performing performance analysis:
- **Reference**: `/docs/official/anthropic/models/choosing-a-model.md`
- **Apply**: Model-appropriate analysis depth and cost considerations
- **Pattern**: Balance analysis thoroughness with resource efficiency

### When doing architecture analysis:
- **Reference**: `/docs/official/anthropic/claude/overview.md`
- **Apply**: Comprehensive prompt engineering for system evaluation
- **Pattern**: Use structured reasoning for complex system assessment

## Response Enhancement Patterns

### Clarity and Directness
- Use specific, actionable language
- Structure responses with clear sections
- Provide concrete examples and evidence
- Reference: `prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct.md`

### Reasoning and Analysis
- Show reasoning steps in complex analysis
- Break down problems systematically  
- Provide confidence scores with justification
- Reference: `prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought.md`

### Tool Integration
- Reference tool capabilities in responses
- Suggest appropriate tool combinations
- Provide tool-specific implementation guidance
- Reference: `claude/tool-use.md`

## Error Handling Integration
- Reference API error patterns for troubleshooting
- Apply systematic error classification
- Provide clear resolution steps
- Reference: `api/errors.md`

## Model Selection Guidance
- Consider task complexity for model selection
- Balance capability requirements with cost
- Apply model-specific features appropriately
- Reference: `models/choosing-a-model.md`
